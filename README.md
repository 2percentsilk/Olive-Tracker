# üê∂ Olive Tracker

An application used for tracking places [Olive the Corgi](https://www.instagram.com/olivemycorgi/) has visited.
Familiarize yourself with this app to get started on our team before tackling the main repo!

## Get Started

## Install developer tools

1. Allow installation of unshipped software by running this from an elevated command prompt:

    ```
    \\PreRelease\JustLetMeRunThis\Prerelease.cmd
    ```
    
1. Install the .NET Core SDK version specified in our [global.json](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_git/VSCloudKernel?path=%2Fglobal.json). E.g. [.NET Core SDK 3.1.102](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-3.1.102-windows-x64-installer)
1. Unzip the [nuget.exe and the VSTS Credential Provider](https://devdiv.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/nuget/client/CredentialProviderBundle.zip) and make sure the directory with the expanded files is on your system's `PATH`.
1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and we use it mostly for development in TypeScript and debugging our VS Code extension.
1. Install [TypeScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript) to compile our code locally.
1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for the fun of it!

### Additional recommended tools/SDKs


* [CosmosDB Local Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) We use Cosmos DB for a number of our data stores, and there may arise a time where you'd like to test these services locally.
* [Advanced REST client](https://install.advancedrestclient.com/install#/install) Installing some sort of REST client so you can make HTTP requests/web socket connections to test RichNav web APIs easily.
